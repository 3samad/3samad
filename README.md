# Hi there! 👋
- My name is Abdessamad - I'm a _civil engineer_ with experience in railway construction management. 
- I'm looking to transition into the field of _data science_. I have always been fascinated by the power of data and its ability to drive insights and improve decision-making.
- With a strong foundation in engineering principles and a love for extracting valuable information from complex datasets, I have now embarked on a new chapter as a _data science student_ at WBS Coding School.
- On GitHub, I am excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to innovative projects.
